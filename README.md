## üí°Introduction

In the previous View system, drawing a Bitmap Image from a `View` was straightforward. However, with Jetpack Compose's unique characteristics, achieving the same is different. This library provides a simple way to capture Composable content into a Bitmap, making it suitable for Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting WebAssembly (WASM), Android, iOS, and desktop.

## üöÄ Implementation

You can check the [/app](/app) directory, which includes an example application for demonstration.

### Gradle setup

In the `build.gradle.kts` of the relevant module, include this dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.shreyaspatil:capturable:2.1.0")
}
```

_You can find the latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/Capturable/releases)_.

### Usage

#### 1. Setup the controller

To capture Composable content, you need an instance of the [`CaptureController`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/index.html), which allows you to decide when to capture the content. You can obtain the instance as follows:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()
}
```

_[`rememberCaptureController()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/remember-capture-controller.html) is a Composable function._

#### 2. Add the content

To capture a specific component, apply a `capturable()` Modifier to that @Composable component as shown:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()

    // Composable content to be captured.
    // Here, everything inside the following Column will be captured
    Column(modifier = Modifier.capturable(captureController)) {
        MovieTicketContent(...)
    }
}
```

#### 3. Capture the content

To capture the content, use [`CaptureController#captureAsync()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/captureAsync.html) as follows:

```kotlin
// Example: Capture the content when a button is clicked
val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
Button(onClick = {
    // Capture content
    scope.launch {
        val bitmapAsync = captureController.captureAsync()
        try {
            val bitmap = bitmapAsync.await()
            // Do something with `bitmap`.
        } catch (error: Throwable) {
            // Handle the error
        }
    }
}) { ... }
```

When this method is called, a request to capture the content is sent, and `ImageBitmap` is returned asynchronously. _This method is safe to call from the Main thread._

By default, it captures the Bitmap using [`Bitmap.Config`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config) **ARGB_8888**. You can modify this by providing a different config from the [`Bitmap.Config` enum](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config).

Example:

```kotlin
captureController.captureAsync(Bitmap.Config.ALPHA_8)
```

That's all you need!
